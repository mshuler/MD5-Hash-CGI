# Simple CGI form to generate MD5 hashes suitable for use in /etc/shadow and an
# Apache AuthUserFile. Input is checked for strength with Data::Password and
# the hash is generated using Crypt::PasswdMD5.
#   apt-get install libdata-password-perl libcrypt-passwdmd5-perl \
#                   aspell wamerican
#   (or other language dictionaries)
#
# This allows users to maintain password secrecy and allows sysadmins to
# enforce strong passwords.  A sysadmin should never need to create, send, or
# receive a user's plain-text password; just ask the user for a hash.
